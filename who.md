			<h2>Not just another nerd</h2>

		<p>Like many of the people who might read this, the reason why I am here and where it all begins simply starts with my passion and fascination with computers and technology. I can start writing a lot about this and how I ended up here but then it would be boring and you can simply go and check out my linkedin page for that matter. Therefore, I want you to get to know more about other aspects of me.</p>

				<p>My last name ("Hadi") translates to someone who guides others in Persian which is my mother tongue. Fortunately, this just does not only come as a last name for me but this is a blessing I had along the way for most of my life so far. As my parrent still tell me memories about my childhood, I had the ability to gather other children and talk to them about different things and they would listen. Being in a team or group, trying to accompany others, finding the best in people, and encouraging them to excel is what I am good at and what I do naturally.</p>

					<h3>Someone who cares about others </h3>
				</header>
				<p>If you know me already or if you take a look at my LinkedIn, you will see I have been assisting many students so far in my career under different circumstances. I really enjoy talking to students and sharing my experiences with them or helping them with what I know. I usually make very good connections with students who I was in contact with in a way that we talk with each other even long after the time we have been together. To this date, it still surprises me and makes me very honored when students I know come to me once again for advice.</p>

					<h3>A seasoned student(warrior)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Like many of you, my academic career was packed with lots of happy and sad moments. We usually see the achievements and good stuff on each other's social pages but what about the hard times? Or the times we have failed? How to handle these and fight your way through these moments is what I learned and still learning along the way when I faced so many different challenges. I learned how to firmly stand by my ideas and opinions and communicate with others to let them know about my struggles and worries.</p>
