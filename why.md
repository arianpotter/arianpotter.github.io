<h2 id="content">Make an impact</h2>
<p>I have made very good friends with lots of students coming from different countries and communities in my time at tu/e. And I want to continue to do for the remainder of my time! This important fact helps me with being the voice of so many different students, bachelor and master, at the council and reflecting on their worries questions, and problems.</p>

		<h3>For students who like industry</h3>
		<p>I have a big passion for the industry. But as some of you who might know about my experiences or you might experienced it yourself, this passion is a rough one to address at TU/e especially if you are a non-native student. Finding companies or having the chance to gain more industry experience in your industry, especially for students coming from outside of the Netherlands, is what I like to emphasize and make a difference.</p>

		<h3>Difficulties in some courses</h3>
		<p>Are you going through hard times in some of the computer science courses? Or perhaps you are experiencing not a very well-structured syllabus but with demanding exam courses. I have been through some myself and I know many of you who had difficulties as well. I can reflect all of these in council for all of us!</p>

		<h3>more choices as electives</h3>
		<p>We all know when it comes to electives, we have a hard time finding suitable courses for ourselves. I like to address this in the council so we can try to have better and more diverse choices for electives. Interesting courses around subjects like software architecture or engineering, AI, etc.</p>
